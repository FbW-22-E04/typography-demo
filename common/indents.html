    Paragraph Indents Indents Everything in typography is about being subtle,
    and styling the separation between paragraphs is no different. Denoting a
    new paragraph should hardly be noticable to the reader, and first-line
    indents are a good way to achieve that. The first paragraph doesn’t need to
    be indented. Or Margins Spacing is the other way to set off a new paragraph.
    You can do this with the bottom-margin CSS property. We find that using a
    bottom margin makes it a little easier to scan a web page, while indents
    give more of a narrative or newspaper-y feel. But Never Both The purpose of
    a first-line indent or bottom margin is to indicate to the reader that,
    well, you’re starting a new paragraph. Readers aren’t stupid, and they don’t
    need two signs that a new paragraph is happening. That’s redundant.
