        <p>
          You should try to limit the length of your lines to approximately 80
          characters or less. It reduces strain on the reader’s eyes, since they
          don’t need to move back and forth as much. It also helps prevent them
          from jumping to the wrong line when they get to the end of the
          previous line. The end result is that it’s easier for visitors to
          digest your content.

          more difficult to read when your browser window is wide.
